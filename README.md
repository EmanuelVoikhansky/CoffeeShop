# CoffeeShop
A small example project using EXTJS 6 classic to create a small catalog and shopping cart for buying coffee online.

This project is in a very early stage. For now the page can be viewed by opening index.html in FIREFOX.
Chrome integration is in progress and if you use Internet Explorer... Why would you even do that to yourself?

Eventually this project will be deployed to a .war file that can be hosted from any modern server.

Alternatively, if you have the sencha CMD installed on your machine you can view this page using Sencha's build in
jetty servlet. Use the command "sencha app watch" from the CoffeeShop/web directory and the page will be available at
localhost:1841

Note: This application is developed using Sencha EXTJS 6.0.1 GPL version and as such is freely available to anyone
who wants to modify it from this repository.
