# CoffeeShop
A small example project using EXTJS 6 classic to create a small catalog and shopping cart for buying coffee online.

This project is in a very early stage. In the current version you must have sencha CMD to be able to view the project.
The first stage of this project will be the creation of a front end, once that is created back end and standalone deployment
functionality will follow. For now, to view the front end with its non-persisted mock data navigate to the CoffeeShop/web directory
and run the "sencha app watch" command. This will launch a mini-Jetty server that will host the front end code at localhost:1841.
