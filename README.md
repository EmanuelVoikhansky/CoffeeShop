# CoffeeShop
A small example project using EXTJS 6 classic to create a small catalog and shopping cart for buying coffee online.

This project is in a very early stage. For now the page can be viewed by opening index.html in any modern browser,
later on, if time is permitting, this will all be compiled into a .war file for deployment unto a server for proper
hosting.

Note: This application is developed using Sencha EXTJS 6.0.1 GPL version and as such is freely available to anyone
who wants to modify it from this repository.
